# NOTES:

  - pybob is a preliminary implementation of an project build system compatible
     to autoproj, if you have problem you might consider using autoproj

# Prepare Windows for pybob:

  1. install msys2 (https://msys2.github.io/ *preferable 64bit version*)
  2. perform the update steps listed on the msys2 website
  3. open mingw64 shell from msys2 intalled folder
     (**important** do not use the msys shell)
  4. perform following steps in the shell:

          pacman -S wget
          wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rock-simulation/pybob/master/prepare_msys2.sh
          bash prepare_msys2.sh

  5. continue with general install notes

# Prepare Ubuntu for pybob:

       sudo apt-get install git python-yaml python-distro
  or (using python3)

       sudo apt install git python3-yaml python3-distro

You can exclude the distro module by

       export QT5_UBUNTU=True
or `False` if you have a older system which is incompatible with QT5.

# Prepare Mac OS X for pybob:

  For OS X it is recommended to use python3.6 and Qt5, although the tools generally are compatible to python2.7 and Qt4.
  
  1. Install MacPorts (https://www.macports.org), which is used by pybob to install system dependencies.
     **Note**: follow the install instructions on the macports website carefully.
  2. Install git and wget:
  
          sudo port install git wget
    
  3. Install python38 and python yaml package via MacPorts:
  
          sudo port install py38-yaml
  
  4. It is recommended to select python3.8 as default for the terminal:
  
          sudo port select --set python python3.8
  
  5. To use the pybob gui and exported plot gui of MARS:
  
          sudo port install py38-sip py38-pyqt5
  
  6. To use the exported plot gui of MARS some more packages are needed:
  
          sudo port install py38-scipy py38-matplotlib
  
  7. To generate pdf plots with latex support:
  
          sudo port install texlive texlive-latex-extra

# Install MARS via pybob

       mkdir mars-dev
       cd mars-dev
       git clone https://github.com/rock-simulation/pybob.git
       cd pybob
       ./pybob.py buildconf path="https://github.com/rock-simulation/simulation-buildconf.git"
       cd ..
       source env.sh

       bob-fetch
       bob-install

  You can start MARS in the terminal via `mars_app`.
  Once you open a new terminal you have to `source env.sh` again.
  
# Todo:
  - check if "git pull" fails
